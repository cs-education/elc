  <h2>Intro to C</h2> Every full C program begins inside a
  function called "main". A function is simply a collection
  of commands that do "something". The main function is
  always called when the program first executes. From main,
   we can call other functions, whether they be written by
   us or by others or use built-in language features. To
   access the standard functions that comes with your
   compiler, you need to include a header with the #include
   directive. What this does is effectively take everything
   in the header and paste it into your program. Let's look
   at a working program:

  <pre class="text">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
printf( "I am alive!  Beware.\n" );
return 0;
}</pre>
  <h2>Here is some more Code!</h2>
  <pre class="text">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
printf("I am a second piece of code\n");
return 0;
}</pre>

<script type="text/javascript" src="jor1k-embed.js"></script>
